## How to Open an Unsigned App or DMG

As I am not a registered Apple developer (99$/year are way too much for the amount I make out of my software ðŸ™ƒ) you will see a warning that the app is from an unidentified developer and it wonâ€™t open.

Follow these steps to allow it:

1. Open **System Settings**.
2. Go to **Privacy & Security**.
3. Scroll down to the bottom where you see the **Security** section.
4. You should see a message saying the app was blocked from opening because itâ€™s not from an identified developer.
5. Click the **Open Anyway** button.
6. Confirm you want to open the app in the next prompt.

This process is required since macOS now enforces stricter security for unsigned apps.
